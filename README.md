Send it?
```

## Authentication

The agent requires two authentications:

### 1. OpenOnion (LLM Provider)

```bash
co auth
```

Provides access to managed LLM APIs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) with free credits.

### 2. Google OAuth (Gmail + Calendar Access)

```bash
co auth google
```

Grants permissions for:
- Gmail read (`gmail.readonly`)
- Gmail send (`gmail.send`)
- Gmail modify (`gmail.modify`)
- Calendar full access (`calendar`) - for scheduling meetings and creating Google Meet links

All credentials are stored securely in `.env` file.

## CLI Commands

### Interactive Mode (Default)

```bash
python cli.py
```

Interactive REPL with slash commands and autocomplete. Just type `/` to see available commands.

### Direct CLI Commands

```bash
python cli.py inbox              # Show recent emails
python cli.py inbox -n 20        # Show 20 emails
python cli.py inbox --unread     # Only unread emails
python cli.py search "from:bob"  # Search emails
python cli.py today              # Daily briefing
python cli.py contacts           # Show cached contacts
python cli.py sync               # Sync contacts from Gmail
python cli.py init               # Initialize CRM database
python cli.py unanswered         # Find unanswered emails
python cli.py ask "question"     # One-shot question
```

### Python API

```python
from agent import agent

# Read recent inbox
agent.input("Show me my last 10 emails")

# Search specific sender
agent.input("Find emails from bob@company.com this month")

# Schedule meetings (proactive - agent finds free slots)
agent.input("Schedule a meeting with alice@example.com")

# Send email (agent drafts based on context)
agent.input("Send a follow-up email to bob@example.com")
```

## Gmail Search Syntax

**Filter by sender/recipient:**
```
from:alice@example.com
to:bob@example.com
```

**Filter by content:**
```
subject:invoice
meeting
```

**Filter by status:**
```
is:unread
is:important
is:starred
```

## How It Works

### Architecture

```python
from connectonion import Agent, Gmail, GoogleCalendar, Memory, Shell, TodoList
from connectonion.useful_plugins import react

# Tools
gmail = Gmail()           # 17 email operations
calendar = GoogleCalendar()  # 9 calendar operations
memory = Memory()         # Persistent memory
shell = Shell()           # Shell commands (date, etc.)
todo = TodoList()         # Task tracking

# Agent combines LLM + tools + plugins
agent = Agent(
    name="email-agent",
    tools=[gmail, calendar, memory, shell, todo],
    plugins=[react],      # ReAct reasoning pattern
    model="co/gemini-2.5-pro",
    system_prompt="prompts/gmail_agent.md"
)

# Natural language → Tool calls → Results
agent.input("Schedule a meeting with alice@example.com")
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **First run**: Agent detects missing credentials
2. **Prompts user**: "Run authentication now?" with numbered options
3. **Option 1 - Automatic**: Agent runs `co auth` and `co auth google` for you
4. **Option 2 - Manual**: Shows clear instructions with commands to run
5. **Stores tokens**: Saves to `.env` for future sessions

### Memory System

The agent maintains conversation context:

```python
# First query
agent.input("Show me emails from Alice")
# → Searches and shows results

# Follow-up (remembers context)
agent.input("Get the full text of the second one")
# → Knows which email you mean
```

## Development

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Using Tox

```bash
tox                    # Run all tests
tox -e coverage        # With coverage report
tox -e lint            # Code quality checks
```

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── test_memory.py     # Memory system tests
└── test_agent.py      # Agent functionality
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing guide.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

All stored in `.env` (auto-generated during setup):

```bash
# LLM Provider (OpenOnion)
OPENONION_API_KEY=...
AGENT_ADDRESS=0x...

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
GOOGLE_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT=...
GOOGLE_SCOPES=gmail.send,gmail.readonly,gmail.modify,calendar
GOOGLE_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com
```

### Security

- ✅ All data stays in your Gmail
- ✅ No external database
- ✅ OAuth tokens encrypted and locally stored
- ✅ Read-only by default (send requires explicit command)

**Never commit `.env` to git** - it's already in `.gitignore`

### Scheduled automation (briefing + reply drafts)

Automation is a **separate entrypoint** from `python cli.py` and `main.py`’s `host()`. When enabled, it runs on a timer (cron or `--loop`), builds the same **daily briefing** as `/today` via `do_today()`, **generates suggested reply drafts** for new mail in the scan window (optionally informed by a refreshed `data/writing_style.md`), and writes one JSON file the frontend can read.

**Each successful run:**

1. Exits immediately if `automation/automation_config.json` has `"running": false`.
2. Optionally refreshes `data/writing_style.md` from sent mail (at most about once per day) before drafting.
3. Builds **briefing** text with `do_today()` — same ~24 hour behavior as interactive `/today`.
4. Lists inbox messages since `lastScannedAt` (or the last 24 hours if the watermark is missing), generates **reply drafts** for that slice, and **merges** them with any unsent drafts already in the JSON so the UI does not lose in-progress edits.
5. Writes `automation/data/automation_briefing.json` (briefing sections, summary, scan metadata, drafts) and advances `lastScannedAt`.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `automation/automation_config.json` | `"running"` toggles automation; `"lastScannedAt"` stores the scan watermark (updated after each run). |
| `automation/data/automation_briefing.json` | Payload for the briefing UI: sections, summary, and draft list. |

**One-shot (e.g. cron):**
```bash
cd capstone-project-26t1-3900-w18a-date
python automation/run_automation.py
```

**Cron example (daily at 8:00, or hourly):**
```cron
# Daily at 8am
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/EmailAI/capstone-project-26t1-3900-w18a-date && python automation/run_automation.py

# Every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/EmailAI/capstone-project-26t1-3900-w18a-date && python automation/run_automation.py
```

**In-process loop** (systemd, screen, etc.):
```bash
cd capstone-project-26t1-3900-w18a-date
python automation/run_automation.py --loop --interval 3600
```

**CLI flags:** `--loop` (repeat every `--interval` seconds), `--interval SECONDS` (default `3600`), `-v` / `--verbose`.

**oo-chat:** Set `CAPSTONE_ROOT` to the capstone repo root so `GET /api/automation/briefing` reads `automation/data/automation_briefing.json` under that root (same tree `send_reply.py` / `refine_draft.py` use). Set `BRIEFING_FILE_PATH` only to override the JSON path (e.g. a copied file). If neither is set, oo-chat falls back to sibling paths next to the app. Send/refine still shell out to `automation/send_reply.py` and `automation/refine_draft.py` (JSON on stdin). No Python HTTP server is required.


## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" Error

Run authentication:
```bash
co auth
co auth google
```

### "Insufficient credits" Error

Your OpenOnion account needs credits. Contact support or add credits via the dashboard.

### "Permission denied" on Gmail

Re-authenticate with Google:
```bash
co auth google
# Make sure to grant all requested permissions
```

### Token Expired

Tokens auto-refresh, but if you see errors:
```bash
rm .env
python cli.py  # Will prompt for fresh authentication
```

## What Can You Do?

### Daily Workflow
```
gmail> /today
```
Get a prioritized briefing: urgent emails, today's meetings, follow-ups needed.

### Email Triage
```
gmail> Help me clean up my inbox
```
Agent categorizes emails, drafts replies for important ones, suggests what to archive.

### Meeting Scheduling
```
gmail> Set up a call with Mike next week
```
Agent finds free slots, checks your recent conversation with Mike, proposes meeting with smart title.

### Contact Research
```
gmail> Who is john@company.com?
```
Agent searches all emails, analyzes relationship history, summarizes key interactions.

### Batch Replies
```
gmail> Reply to all unanswered emails
```
Agent finds gaps, drafts replies matching your style, sends with one confirmation.

### Deal Tracking
```
gmail> What's happening with the Acme deal?
```
Agent traces full email history, shows timeline, identifies pending actions.

## Philosophy

**"Gmail is your database"** - No manual data entry. No separate CRM. Just direct Gmail access with AI understanding.

**"Tools first, features later"** - Start with solid low-level primitives (read, search, send), then build higher-level analysis.

**"Keep simple things simple"** - 2-minute setup, natural language commands, automatic authentication.
